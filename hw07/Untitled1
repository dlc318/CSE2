Program Write a program that forces the user to enter an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive, and then prints out displays that depend on the value entered and look like the following: 
               Enter a number between 1 and 9- 4

You should use loops to create each of the three stacks of number. The first stack should be created only using for loops. 
The second stack should be created only using while loops. The third stack should be created only using do-while loops. 
Start by writing a program that prints the first stack and get it running. Then it is straightforward to modify a copy of 
that code (which uses for loops) to write code that uses only while loops. Once you have code that generates the top two 
stacks you can easily modify the code to generate the third diamond that only uses do-while loops.

Note 1. Most of the work on this assignment involves writing code to produce the first stack.  It is best not to fuss too 
much over the precise details of the for loops. Instead, make a stab at getting it right and then try it out. You can then 
fiddle with your code to get it exactly right.
