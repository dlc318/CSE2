Objectives. For this lab session you will get practice with elementary array operations.

Program. Write a program that performs the following tasks:

Create an array that can hold 10 ints
Ask the user enter 10 ints and store them in the array
Search the array for the highest entry and print it out
Search the array for the lowest entry and print it out
Sum the ints in the array and print out the sum
Copy the contents of the array into a second array in reverse order 
Print the contents of the two arrays in two columns, side by side. 
Below is sample output that your program should resemble:

Enter 10 ints- -9 20 8 9 23 45 1 2 89 70
The lowest entry is -9
The highest entry is 89
The sum is 258
    -9     70
    20     89
     8      2
     9      1
    23     45
    45     23
     1      9
     2      8
    89     20
    70     -9

Note: For simplicity, assume that the user only enters ints.
